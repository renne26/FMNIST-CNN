# About the Repository
This is a Convolutional Neural Network I made using Tensorflow, the neural network was trained on the Fashion-MNIST Dataset  
The neural networks that are tested here are all designed by me, however inspirations were took from some of the state-of-the-art models and techniques such as residual neural networks were used  
Feel free to clone this repository and run or modify the jupyter notebook to play around with the Convolutional Neural Networks

# Note
The model files that were saved during the hypertuning process was omitted as it was too big of a file
